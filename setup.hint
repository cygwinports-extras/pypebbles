sdesc: "Jeweled clone with colored stones"
ldesc: "A board is filled with stones of different colors. Your goal is 
to make lines of stones of the same color. Two neighbouring stones can 
swap places, but only if a line of three or more stones is formed that 
way.  Those lines will then disappear, letting other stones fall down. 
You score points for every line that disappears. It's that simple!"
